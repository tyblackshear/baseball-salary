# Determinants of Baseball Players Salaries: The Puzzle of Underpaid Millionaires
# The salary and batting data was gathered from Lahman’s Baseball Database in which specific batting factors were extracted from every player during the 2016 MLB Season.
# Combined two different datasets to match the salary and performance information, and sliced the combined data for the year 2016 season only. 
# Batting average (BA) is a well-known formula to measure the performance of baseball hitters.
# BA calculation leads us to conclude that none of the factors in the chosen linear model is significant. 
#As a result, we were supposed to propose a new model to examine the significant factors of deciding a player’s salary.
